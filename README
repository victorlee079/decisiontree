Basic usage:
To build the tree using default setting and provided training/testing set
java -jar dectree.jar

Available Configurations
1. -t
To set the training set file path
Default: "./data/train/adult.data"
Example usage:
java -jar dectree.jar -t "./data/train/adult.data"
2. -e
To set the evaluation set file path
Default: "./data/test/adult.test"
Example usage:
java -jar dectree.jar -e "./data/test/adult.test"
3. -n
To set threshold (i.e. number of records) to stop further splitting
Default: 400
Example usage:
To set threshold to 500
java -jar dectree.jar -n 500
4. -m
To use a pre-built model
If set, it will not build the model from the training set. The program will look for the pre-built model from folder "./build".
The model to be loaded depends on the threshold, e.g. "dt750.bin" refers to the model built with threshold 750.
Example usage: 
To use dt500.bin as the pre-built model
java -jar dectree.jar -m -n 500
